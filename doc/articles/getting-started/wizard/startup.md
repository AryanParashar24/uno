The main page of the wizard shows and the default template is selected.

![](assets/wizard-intro.jpg)

This is introductory page to the wizard and lets you choose between the blank or default template, and also enables you to customize that selection even further if you click *Customize*.

- **Blank**

    The *Blank* template generates a minimal Uno Platform app that targets the following platforms:

    - Windows
    - Android
    - iOS
    - macOS
    - GTK
    - WASM

    Click "Create" or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept the selected choice and generate the project, or select the Default template.

    This is the structure of the generated blank project:

- **Default**

    The *Customize* button lets you customize the selected template and fine tune which features should be included with the generated project.  
    When clicking *Customize*, a wizard opens with the pre-selected settings per the choice in the first page (*Blank* or *Default*).

> [!NOTE]  
> When the project opens for the first time, a popup may show up asking to Reload the projects, this is intentional.
